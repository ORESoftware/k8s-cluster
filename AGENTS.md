# Agent guidelines — sonus-auris-monorepo

Git superproject for the Sonus Auris repositories — each app is a git submodule under `apps/`, plus a Nix dev shell (`nix develop`).

## Submodules

Every app lives under `apps/<name>` as a git submodule pinned to a commit on its
`main`. Never `rm -rf` a submodule directory. To repoint a submodule, commit and
push **inside** that submodule, then stage the updated gitlink here with
`git add apps/<name>`. Put ordinary scratch files under `tmp/` (gitignored). Put a worktree there only when a human explicitly instructs its use.

## Command safety — STRICT (all agents MUST follow)

Never run destructive or irreversible shell commands. To remove or move files,
**always go through git** so the change is tracked and recoverable.

**Blacklisted — do NOT run:**
- `rm`, `rm -rf`, `rmdir`, `unlink` — never delete via raw `rm`.
- bulk / indirect deletion: `find … -delete`, `find … -exec rm …`, `xargs rm` — no bypasses of the `rm` ban.
- raw `mv` of tracked files; truncating a tracked file with `>` or `truncate`.
- `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx`, `git checkout -- .` / `git restore .` mass-discard.
- `git stash drop` / `git stash clear`, `git branch -D`, `git tag -d` — destroy unmerged work / refs; not on shared branches unless the operator explicitly asks.
- `git push --force` / history rewrites on shared branches (esp. `main`).
- `dd`, `mkfs`, `shred`, recursive `chmod -R` / `chown -R` on broad paths, fork bombs.

**Whitelisted — safe, prefer these:**
- `git rm` / `git rm --cached` — remove files through git (recoverable via history).
- `git mv` — rename/move through git.
- `git restore <path>` (single file), `git revert`, `git stash` (push) — reversible.
- Editing via the editor tools, `git add`, `git commit`, `git switch -c`.

If a genuinely destructive action seems unavoidable, **STOP and ask the operator
first** — do not improvise around this rule.

## Primary branch and concurrent-agent policy

This policy overrides generic feature-branch and worktree defaults for agent tooling.

- Highly prefer an existing primary branch, in this order: `main`, `dev`, then `master`.
- Work directly on the selected primary branch even when other agents are active. Use another branch only when a human or a repository-specific release process explicitly requires it.
- Never create or use a Git worktree unless a human explicitly instructs you to do so for the current task. Concurrency alone is not permission to use a worktree.
- Concurrent agents must coordinate repository and file ownership through the available agent communication channel, keep edits scoped, inspect live state before each write, and hand off cleanly. Coordinate instead of isolating routine work in worktrees.
- Preserve unrelated in-progress changes and never overwrite another agent's work. If safe ownership of overlapping files cannot be established, pause that overlapping edit and coordinate before continuing.
